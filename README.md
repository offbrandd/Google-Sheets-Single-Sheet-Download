# Google-Sheets-Single-Sheet-Download

this extension looks at active google sheets url and redirects it to a modified url that triggers the download of the current page in an active Google Sheet
google sheets has this functionality built-in, but doesm't provide an UI for the user to do it, so i made this extension to do it
