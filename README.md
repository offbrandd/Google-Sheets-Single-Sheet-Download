# Google-Sheets-Single-Sheet-Download

this chrome extension looks at currently google sheets url and redirects it to a modified url that triggers the download of the current page in an active Google Sheet
my workflow requires that I download a single sheet from a multi-page google sheet
google sheets has this functionality built-in, but doesm't provide an UI for the user to do it, so i made an extension
